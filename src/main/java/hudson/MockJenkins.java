/**
 * Mock for the Jenkins/Hudson object required for processing
 * the various steps.  This became very important after introducing
 * mocking as pretty much every class wants to know what's happening
 * within Jenkins.  Nothing here actually starts the process, and
 * provides a very bland "Jenkins" startup
 *
 * This mock technically should be for Jenkins.class.  However,
 * ExtensionList pretty much requires that the object also be of
 * type Hudson.  Since Mockito works by creating a subclass of the
 * desired class, it has to be of Hudson.  This should be changed
 * when ExtensionList no longer requires a Hudon object.
